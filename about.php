                    <p class="lead">One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the
                        Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with
                        adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an
                        intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific
                        machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to
                        be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End users
                        commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their machine for standalone Java
                        applications, or in a web browser for Java applets.
                        Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics,
                        threading, and networking.</p>

                    <p class="lead mx-5">Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
                        high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
                        Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
                        ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

                        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or
                        binary form for all major platforms from the Python and may be freely distributed. The same site
                        also contains distributions of and pointers to many free
                        third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>

                    <p class="lead">PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web
                        development.It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in
                        1994;the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally
                        stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
                        Preprocessor.

                        PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a
                        daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the
                        interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or
                        binary image data – would form the whole or part of a HTTP response. Various web template
                        systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to
                        orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.</p>

                    <p class="lead mx-5">In November 2016, the Go and Go Mono fonts were released by type designers
                        Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes specifically for use by the Go project. Go is a humanist
                        sans-serif which resembles Lucida Grande and Go Mono is monospaced. Each of the fonts adhere to
                        the WGL4 character set and were designed to be legible with a large x-height and distinct
                        letterforms. Both Go and Go Mono adhere to the DIN 1450 standard by having a slashed zero,
                        lowercase l with a tail, and an uppercase I with serifs.
                        In April 2018, the original logo was replaced with a stylized GO slanting right with trailing
                        streamlines. However, the Gopher mascot remained the same.</p>
